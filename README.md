# Plant Management System

A comprehensive system to manage and visualize the tasks involved in managing a plantation, including lunar phase tracking, cyclic events, and plant bed management.

## Project Overview

This project, developed for **Lokelani Essentials**' plantation, allows users to manage and view plantation tasks through a calendar interface. Built with **Wagtail** and **CoderedCMS**, the platform provides users with a rich, intuitive interface for handling recurring tasks, moon phases, and plant bed management.

## Features

- **Cyclic Events**: Create, update, and delete recurring events such as grass cutting, lemongrass trimming, and plant feeding.
- **Plant Bed Management**: Allows managing up to 16 plant beds with information on plantations in each bed.
- **Admin Interface**: Streamlined admin functionality, including filtering and management of cyclic events, to maintain data consistency.
- **Customizable Calendar**: Enables viewing tasks across multiple dates, with a clear color-coded system for easy identification.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend development
- **Django**: Web framework
- **Wagtail + CoderedCMS**: CMS functionality and page templating
- **SQLite3**: Database for initial development, with potential for future scalability
